=====

Program for estimating the distribution of selection coefficients (fitness effects) from phylogenetic data using a site-wise mutation-selection model.

This is an implementation of the model described in "Tamuri AU, dos Reis M, Goldstein RA. Estimating the Distribution of Selection Coefficients from Phylogenetic Data Using Sitewise Mutation-Selection Models. [Genetics vol. 190 no. 3 1101-1115](http://www.genetics.org/content/190/3/1101.full)." 

The data used in the manuscript is available in [etc/](https://github.com/tamuri/tdg12/tree/master/etc).

[Binary download](https://github.com/downloads/tamuri/tdg12/tdg12_mathbio.zip) of v1.0. Includes tdg12.jar (with dependencies) and the tutorial.
